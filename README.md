# VivoVR
VivoVR is a multiplayer VR framework built on Unity Multiplayer Services, designed to provide a smooth, scalable, and feature-rich networking solution tailored for Gorilla Tag fan games. It aims to be a modern alternative to PhotonVR, offering advanced integration, full player synchronization, and built-in voice chat support with Vivox.

Features
Player Synchronization: Real-time syncing of player movements, rotations, and actions.

Custom Player Properties: Supports usernames, player colors, cosmetics, and other customizable properties.

Voice Chat Integration: Uses Vivox for clear, low-latency voice communication between players.

Room Management: Seamless room creation, joining, and management via Unity Lobby and Relay services.

Netcode for GameObjects: Leverages Unityâ€™s official netcode for stable multiplayer synchronization.


Optimized for Gorilla Tag Fan Games: Designed with Gorilla Tag-style VR multiplayer games in mind, but adaptable to other VR projects.
